    Delete the current line and send caret to beginning of text in next line.
    
    When you use Wing's default `delete-line` command to delete a line, it
    sends the caret to column 0, which is annoying. This script fixes that by
    first deleting a line, then sending the caret to the beginning of the text
    on the next line.
