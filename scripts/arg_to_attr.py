def arg_to_attr(editor=wingapi.kArgEditor):
    '''
    Turn an argument to `__init__` into an instance attribute.
    
    For example, you have just typed this:
    
        class MyObject(object):
            def __init__(self, crunchiness):
                <Cursor is here>
                
    (Of course, you can substitute `crunchiness` for whatever your argument's
    name is.)
    
    Now, you might want to put a `self.crunchiness = crunchiness` line in that
    `__init__` method. But that would take so much typing, because
    `self.crunchiness` doesn't exist yet, and won't be autocompleted. That
    would require you to make around 20 keystrokes. I don't know about you, but
    I'm just not ready for that kind of a commitment.
    
    Instead, type `crunchiness`. (You'll get autocompletion because it exists
    as an argument.) Then run this `arg_to_attr` script. (I personally use
    `Alt-Insert A` for it.)
    
    The final result is that you'll get a `self.crunchiness = crunchiness` line
    and have the cursor ready in the next line.
