    Go to a specified line number in editor, temporarily showing line numbers.
    
    This script is intended for people who don't like Wing to always show line
    numbers in the editors, but who *do* want to see them temporarily when
    using Wing's `goto-line` command, usually invoked by Ctrl-L, to go to a
    specific line.
    
    Using this script you can see exactly which line you're going to before
    issuing the command; and if usually keep line numbers hidden, then they
    will be hidden automatically after Wing has moved to the specified line.
