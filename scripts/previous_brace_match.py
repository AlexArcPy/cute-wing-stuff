    Select the previous pair of braces.
    
    Similar to Wing's built-in `brace-match`, except it goes backwards instead
    of going forwards. Goes to the nearest pair of braces, whether it's (), [],
    or {} that's before the current caret position, and selects those braces
    including all their content.
    
    Known limitation: Doesn't know to ignore braces found in strings.
    
    Suggested key combination: `Ctrl-Bracketleft`
