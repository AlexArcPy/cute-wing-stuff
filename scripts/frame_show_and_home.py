    Go to the line of the current frame and send caret to beginning of text.
    
    When you use Wing's default `frame-show` command to go to the line of the
    current frame, it sends the caret to column 0, which is annoying. This
    script fixes that by first doing `frame-show`, then sending the caret to
    the beginning of the text.
