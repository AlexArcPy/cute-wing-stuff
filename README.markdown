A collection of scripts for [Wing IDE 4](http://www.wingware.com/).

In order to use these scripts in your copy of Wing, download the repo to
someplace in your computer, fire up Wing, go to `Edit` -> `Preferences` -> `IDE
Extension Scripting` and add the path of the repo's `scripts` folder to your
`Search Path`. (Possibly you'll need to do `edit` -> `Reload All Scripts` to
get Wing to see them for the first time.)

After you do that, the commands will become available in Wing; For example you
could do `Ctrl-F12` and then type `flip-case` to activate the `flip_case`
scripts. But you probably want to bind these commands to a key sequence; do
that in `Edit` -> `Preferences` -> `Keyboard` -> `Custom Key Bindings`.)
